# Repository Templates

The purpose of this repository is to house some common repository templates.

These can be called from within internal packages or written directly as needed.

When using version control it is important to practise good hygeine regarding data and privacy.

## Things that shouldn't be a repository

* Large data sets
* Any confidential or private data
* Authorization tokens, passwords, credentials
* Virtual environments

## Documents we have

.gitignore for what git should ignore
.gitattributes for how git should track some things (e.g. binaries vs text)
.dockerignore for what docker should ignore
